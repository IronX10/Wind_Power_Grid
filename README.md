# ðŸ”Œ Power Grid Analyzer (COL106 Assignment 6)

## ðŸ“– Overview
This Java program models a national power grid as an undirected graph, where:
- **Cities** are nodes.
- **Transmission lines** are edges.

It identifies **critical transmission lines** (bridges) and efficiently answers queries about how many such important lines exist between two cities using a **bridge tree** and **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** approach.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Detects **critical lines** (bridges) using Tarjanâ€™s algorithm.
- Constructs a **bridge tree** from the original graph.
- Uses **binary lifting** to preprocess for fast LCA queries.
- Answers number of important transmission lines between two cities in `O(log n)` time.

## ðŸ›  Dependencies
Make sure the following are set up:
- Java JDK (8 or higher)
- `javac` and `java` in PATH
